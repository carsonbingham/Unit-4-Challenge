    "# Springboard Data Science Career Track Unit 4 Challenge - Tier 3 Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "Hey! Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London [(here's some info for the curious)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This is the Tier 3 notebook, which means it's not filled in at all: we'll just give you the skeleton of a project, the brief and the data. It's up to you to play around with it and see what you can find out! Good luck! If you struggle, feel free to look at easier tiers for help; but try to dip in and out of them, as the more independent work you do, the better it is for your learning!***\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will make use of only what you learned in the following DataCamp courses: \n",
    "- Prework courses (Introduction to Python for Data Science, Intermediate Python for Data Science)\n",
    "- Data Types for Data Science\n",
    "- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part One) \n",
    "- pandas Foundations\n",
    "- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "- Merging DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the tools, techniques and concepts in the above DataCamp courses, this challenge should require the application of the following: \n",
    "- **pandas**\n",
    "    - **data ingestion and inspection** (pandas Foundations, Module One) \n",
    "    - **exploratory data analysis** (pandas Foundations, Module Two)\n",

    "Data Science is magical. In this case study, you'll get to apply some complex machine learning algorithms. But as  [David Spiegelhalter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUs1uvsz0Ok) reminds us, there is no substitute for simply **taking a really, really good look at the data.** Sometimes, this is all we need to answer our question.\n",

It should have consolidated your data hygiene and pandas skills by looking at a real-world problem involving just the kind of dataset you might encounter as a budding data scientist. Congratulations, and looking forward to seeing you at the next step in the course! "

    "I found out that the Hackney borough had increased the most in average housing prices from 1998 to 2018. However, the most expensive borough to buy a house in is Kensington & Chelsea, which was 9th in terms of growth from 1998 to 2018. Every borough except for Hounslow (3.98x) increased by at least 4x from 1998 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "I arrived at these conclusions by analyzing and graphing the data at different stages of refinement. At the end, I had a clear bar graph of the growth ratios for every borough, which I then narrowed down to the top 12 boroughs. Before that, however, I had to clean the dataset and create usable, clean data for the 32 districts (and the overall City of London) by removing rows with null values, ensuring that every column had the same amount of data, and ensuring that all the data in each column was of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encountered challenges when creating the ratio function. The examples provided were hard for me to understand, so I ended up using another method which I felt more comfortable with and functioned the same. Cleaning the data was also a bit of a hassle, but I overcame it and was able to extract clean data. StackOverflow was an amazing resource to use during this, and I commonly referred to it whenever I got stuck or forgot the parameters for a function/method. I also wasn’t sure what pandas used as its “datetime” object so it took a bit to figure that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would be curious to graph the changes over time in housing prices for each district on the same graph, just to compare growth rates and to see if they followed the same trends. It would also be interesting to look at the reasoning behind the increase; maybe comparing it to a graph of interest increase over time, or graphing the correlation between the two datasets."
